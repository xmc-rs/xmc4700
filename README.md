This is a 'peripheral access crate' for interfacing to the XMC4700 series of microcontrollers for embedded support in Rust that is generated using [svd2rust](https://docs.rs/svd2rust) and an SVD file provided by Infineon.

All API's and usage (besides what registers exist) are defined by [svd2rust](https://docs.rs/svd2rust)

## Generate Crate from SVD

```bash
# Necessary 3rd-party tools
cargo install svd2rust
cargo install form
rustup component add rustfmt

svd.sh # Generates code from crate and formats to rustfmt
```
